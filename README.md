# Incremental Deployment Method of Segment Routing over an IPv6 (SRv6) Network Based on Graph Neural Network (GNN) and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)


## Abstract
Motivation: To solve the problem of network load imbalance caused by the inability of the current algorithm to fully perceive network status information, and the incremental deployment of segment routing over IPv6 (SRv6) network.
